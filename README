Deployment:
1. Rename auth.js.example to auth.js and fill in the clientID and clientSecret fields for each login method.
2. Replace the placeholder session secret ('mySecret') in index.js.
3. If necessary, change the port and hostname for app.listen in index.js.
4. Run npm install
5. Run npm start

Testing:
After the service has been deployed, it can be tested by navigating to localhost:8080 (or whatever hostname and port was set in step 3 of deployment.
This will load a test page that will allow you to verify that the settings that you configured during deployment are correct.
However, note that upon a successful login the server will attempt to redirect you to the appropriate page in the Blue Jay app.
This redirect will fail if the Blue Jay app has not actually been deployed.
